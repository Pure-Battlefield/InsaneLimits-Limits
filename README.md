InsaneLimits-Limits
===================

This Repo is used to store most of the InsaneLimit Limits that we use on our servers. All default limits should be in the "Defaults" folder.
Limits with server specific code (NewsOnSpawn, NextMapAndMode, etc) should be in a folder for that specific server, and the default limit (minus the server specific code) should be in the "Defaults" folder.

When adding new limits, please provide as many coments in the code as possible so people know how to edit the limit if they need to.

If you are adding a limit from another source, please try to add any comments in the code where you see fit.
